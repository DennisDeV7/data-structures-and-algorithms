# Challenge Summary

The challenge is to create a function that will take in a list and sort it in ascending order by insertion

## Whiteboard Process

[Insertion README](sorting/insertion/README.md)

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time: O(n^2)
      - The time complexity is exponential because the function required to loop through the entire array at times for each number. As the list size increases, the time increases by the size of the list squared.

- Space: O(1)
      - The space efficiency is constant because the function executes the sort in place and does not require additional space.

## Solution

To run code:

From the python folder and virtual environment active: `python code_challenges/insertion_sort.py`

To run tests:

From the python folder and virtual environment active: `tests/code_challenges/test_insertion_sort.py`

4/4 tests pass
